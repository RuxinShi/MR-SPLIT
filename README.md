# MR-SPLIT
This project aims to publish codes and results that can be used to apply the MR-SPLIT method proposed in the paper 'MR-SPLIT: A Novel Method to Address Selection and Weak Instrument Bias in One-Sample Mendelian Randomization Studies.' 

All these files are viewable using any web browser. In the upper right corner of the document, you have the option to toggle the code display, should you wish to review it. On the left-hand side, a user-friendly interface allows seamless selection and focused review of specific sections of the results.
