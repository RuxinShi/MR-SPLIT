# MR-SPLIT
This project aims to publish codes and results that can be used to apply the MR-SPLIT method proposed in the paper 'MR-SPLIT: A Novel Method to Address Selection and Weak Instrument Bias in One-Sample Mendelian Randomization Studies.' 

These files provide nearly all the code and generated results (including images and tables) used in the simulation and application sections of the paper.

All the .html files are viewable using any web browser. To view them, please download them and open them using any web browser. 
In the upper right corner of the document, you have the option to toggle the code display, should you wish to review it. On the left-hand side, a user-friendly interface allows seamless selection and focused review of specific sections of the results.

All the .qmd files can be opened using RStudio (with Quarto installed). They are quite similar to R Markdown files but are more user-friendly. They can be also viewed online, with R codes included in the chunks.

 If you have any questions, please feel free to email shiruxin@msu.edu
